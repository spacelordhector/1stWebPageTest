            <h2><span>The Beginning of the End: Or Something Cool</span></h2>
            <p>When I was little I used to think that I was always to going to be a hero, saving people and getting all
                the
                praise.
                However, now that I'm 25 years old, in my mid-tweenties, I question my self if can even save the people
                around me.
            </p>
            <p>The one major focus in my life, currently, is getting a job. Why? Because I believe that money will make
                my
                goals and
                dreams a reality.
                Of course this seems obvious because, sadly, the world does revolve around money. Not saying that money
                is
                everything; there are things beyond money but
                money does help.<sup><a href="#References">[1]</a></sup>

            <p>With that being said, here are a list of dreams I have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Support my family</li>
                <li>Have a wife</li>
                <li>Raise my kids and dogs</li>
                <li>Have meaning in life</li>
            </ul>
